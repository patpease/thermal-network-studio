/**
 * Sun and moon, reused from psychrometric-studio.
 *
 * The geometry is copied path-for-path from that tool's `sun.svg` and
 * `moon.svg` so the two studios offer the same control drawn the same way.
 *
 * One thing is NOT copied: the sibling hard-codes its accent hexes (#E2842F on
 * the rays, #2F9BD6 on the stars). Those are its palette, not this one's, and a
 * fixed orange would be the only colour on this page that ignores the theme.
 * They map onto the tokens that already carry the warm/cool split here —
 * `--heat` for anything solar, `--cool` for anything cold — which is the same
 * rule `Mark.tsx` follows.
 *
 * Inline rather than an `<img>`, for the reason set out in `Mark.tsx`: an image
 * cannot see `data-theme`.
