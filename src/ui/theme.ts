/**
 * Light and dark, and who decides.
 *
 * Three states, two buttons. The stored preference is `light`, `dark`, or
 * absent — and absent means *follow the operating system*, which is the state a
 * first-time visitor is in. Pressing either button pins the choice; there is no
 * third "system" button because the state it selects is the one you already
 * have before you press anything.
 *
 * ## How it reaches the stylesheet
 *
 * By setting `data-theme` on the document element, or by removing it. The
 * palette is defined three times in `tokens.css`: light on `:root`, dark inside
 * a `prefers-color-scheme` media query guarded with `:not([data-theme="light"])`,
 * and dark again on a bare `[data-theme="dark"]`. Removing the attribute
 * therefore hands the decision back to the media query rather than leaving a
 * stale choice behind.
 *
 * ## Why there is no pre-hydration script
 *
 * The usual trick — a tiny inline `<script>` in the head that reads storage and
 * stamps the attribute before first paint — is blocked here by the content
 * security policy, which allows no inline script and is worth more than the few
 * milliseconds of flash it would save. The media query covers the default case
 * before React mounts, so the only visible switch is for someone who has
 * *overridden* their system setting, which they did knowingly.
